# UFOs

## Overview
A request was made for a dynamic website that can display a table of UFO data that is pulled from a JavaScript array. The site displays this table along with the capability for the user to filter the UFO data based on multiple criteria. The site was created via HTML/CSS along with Bootstrap while the table was created through JavaScript.

## Results

The default table will appear as shown above. To filter your results you can enter your desired criteria in any of the five spaces to filter on the left side of the page. The filters must be lowercase letters without spaces after them. To reset the table press the "UFO Sightings" button at the top left of the page. 

## Summary
The primary drawback of the site is the unforgiving nature of the filtering. If there is a capitilization, spelling, or formatting error when attempting to filter the table will not be displayed in the desired orientation. 
- Two recommendations  
Firstly, I would suggest would be to format the filtering within to provide more leeway to the user when inputing their filters. 
Second, the time filter only allows one date to be entered, if it accepted a time frame (Ex: 1/1/2010-1/1/2012) rather than one data it could prove to be a more useful filtering tool.
